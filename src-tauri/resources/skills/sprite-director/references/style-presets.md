# Sprite style presets

Use these only when the user did not specify production dimensions. Treat named games as high-level inspiration and keep the output original.

## Inference rules

- A simple request for a style-inspired character should produce a useful animated set, not ask for size.
- A style named directly in the user prompt overrides the workspace or chat preset. Preserve the named traits across every asset in a pack.
- Use the logical canvas dimensions exactly; Sprite Studio previews can scale pixels without changing the source.
- For a single object or icon, do not invent animation.
- For walking, running, attacking, idling, spellcasting, or effects, generate multiple frames even when the user omits a frame count.
- Use 3–6 main colors plus outline and highlight for small sprites. Add colors only when readability requires them.
- Place character feet within the bottom two rows and keep the pivot stable across frames.
- A transparent pixel is not a palette color. Avoid semi-transparent edge pixels for crisp pixel art.

## Style translation

- “Stardew-like” means cozy farming-RPG proportions, warm readable colors, compact pixel clusters, and an original outfit and face. Use the Pixel RPG preset; never reproduce an existing farmer sprite.
- “Pokemon-like” means compact top-down readability, strong color blocking, and an original silhouette; never reproduce an existing creature or trainer.
- “Zelda-like” means readable top-down adventure proportions and iconic equipment shapes; never reproduce Link or franchise symbols.
- When the user names any living artist, studio, or game, describe the transferable traits and create a distinct original asset.
